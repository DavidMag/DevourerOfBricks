# DevourerOfBricks
A simple Brick Breaker game.

This game is the first game that I ever do, made for a school project. 
It's uses my own buildt game engine, I choose to do a own engine because short deadline
and to better understand how game physics work.

Functionality in the game:
- 8 side collision, ball to brick (with error handeling if the balls gets completly inside the brick)
- The ball bounces different depending on how the ball hits the paddle
- Power ups
- Different kind of blocks and levels, buildt with BrickFactory
- Local highscore
- And some basic stuff like clock, points counting, lifes and so on

Functionalty that will be added:
- Google admob/firebase
- Google game services (Leaderboard and achivements)

Feel free to help, come with tips/improvements or ask if you wonder something
